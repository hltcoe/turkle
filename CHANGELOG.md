  includes a link to the Stats page for each User.

## [2.4.1] - 2021-04-29
### Fixed

  the Project, not just Batches with at least one completed Task
  Assignment

  the default allotted_assignment_time for new Batches created

  won't be saved.

  Project-level settings are only used as defaults for new Batches.

  Project forms.
