        The task is assigned to you.

        Returns the currently assigned task so that it is no longer assigned to you.
        If you accept a task from the same batch, that returned task could be assigned to you again.
        If you do not want to work on that particular task, you should skip it.

      <h5>Skip Task</h5>
      <hr>
      <p>
        Skip to the next available task in the Batch.
        The task is removed from your assignments.
        You may see it again if all other tasks have been completed and no one else completed it.
